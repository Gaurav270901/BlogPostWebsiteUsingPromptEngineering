# 📝 Dynamic Blog Platform Using Prompt Engineering

This is a simple, dynamic blog platform created entirely through **prompt engineering** with ChatGPT — without writing a single line of code independently or using pre-built templates. The goal of this project is to **showcase the true power of AI when guided with well-crafted prompts**.

---

## 🎯 What This Project Includes

- A **clean HTML page** with a form to submit blog posts and a section to display them.
- A **modern, minimal CSS design** for readability and user-friendliness.
- A **Node.js Express backend** to handle:
  - `POST` requests to submit blog posts
  - `GET` requests to retrieve posts
- A **JavaScript frontend script** to dynamically fetch and display blog content from the backend.

## ⚙️ How It Was Built (Using ONLY Prompt Engineering)

> Every line of code in this project was generated by AI — based purely on prompts, without the use of any external code or tutorial.

### Why This Matters:
- It proves that **you don't need to be an expert developer** to build something real and functional.
- The key is to **break problems into steps** and ask clearly:
  - "What do I want this file to do?"
  - "What should the user see?"
  - "How does the frontend talk to the backend?"
- Good prompts = Good results.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo or create a new Replit project**.
2. Make sure these files exist:
   - `index.html` – The main HTML structure
   - `style.css` – The CSS for styling
   - `script.js` – JavaScript to fetch/display posts
   - `index.js` – The Node.js Express backend
3. In Replit, run:
   ```bash
   npm install express body-parser
   node index.js
